# My_Projects

These are my initial projects when just expanding on my skills within python to see the possibilities. Within these projects, I learnt the basics of Tkinter to create applications with usable GUIS coupled with other functionalities such as the ability to the use a calculator or an alarm clock. I also created a discord bot out of interest that can lock a user out of joining a call for a set period of time which is still used by my group of friends on a daily basis for fun. It also has a magic 8 ball game attached to it in which it answers from a pool of random responses to any question. 

For future smaller scale projects, I want to create a tic tac toe game with a GUI and bundle it together with PyInstaller to make it into a downable executable file. Furthermore, I want to add other projects that are more usable on a general basis such as an application for file renaming or searching the web.

Thanks for checking out these projects and hope you are enjoying your day!
